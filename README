Compatibility tests for the linux GPIO sysfs interface

This script contains a simple test harness and a comprehensive set of test
cases that can be used to make sure that the linux GPIO sysfs interface at
/sys/class/gpio/ exposed by any user-space compatibility layer works as
expected.

It can of course also be used to just test the existing kernel interface for
regressions.

The script depends exclusively on modules available in the python standard
library and requires the kernel gpio-sim module to be available and loaded
before running.
